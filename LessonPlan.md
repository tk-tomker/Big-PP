Group A – User Interface / Interaction

Goal: Learn how to handle user input, display data, and build menus.

Lesson 1: Python Basics

Variables and data types (int, str, float, list)

Printing and simple input

Basic math and string manipulation

Exercise: Print a welcome message, ask user for their name, and display a greeting.

Lesson 2: Control Flow

if, elif, else statements

while loops

for loops with lists

Exercise: Iterate through a list of items and print them. Take user input to select an item.

Lesson 3: Functions

Defining and calling functions

Passing arguments and returning values

Exercise: Create a function that takes a name and prints a formatted greeting.

Lesson 4: Data Storage in Memory

Lists and dictionaries for storing multiple items

Adding, removing, and accessing items

Exercise: Store a collection of items in a dictionary and print each key/value.

Lesson 5: Bringing it Together

Combining loops, conditionals, and functions

Basic menu-driven programs

Exercise: Create a menu that repeatedly asks the user for choices and performs actions accordingly.

Group B – Logic & Calculations

Goal: Learn how to manipulate data and perform calculations.

Lesson 1: Python Basics

Variables, data types, arithmetic operations

Printing results of calculations

Exercise: Write a small calculator that adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides numbers.

Lesson 2: Functions

Defining functions to encapsulate calculations

Parameters and return values

Exercise: Write a function to compute the area of a rectangle, given length and width.

Lesson 3: Lists and Dictionaries

Storing multiple items and mapping values

Looping through collections

Exercise: Store numbers in a list, compute the sum and average using a loop.

Lesson 4: Loops and Iteration

for loops for processing lists

while loops for repeated calculations

Nested loops (basic)

Exercise: Given a list of numbers, calculate a running total and maximum value.

Lesson 5: Putting it Together

Combine functions, loops, and data structures

Practice with small “calculation challenges”

Exercise: Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of their squares.

Group C – Data Storage / Persistence

Goal: Learn how to save and load data for use later.

Lesson 1: Python Basics & Data Structures

Lists, dictionaries, tuples

Accessing and modifying items

Exercise: Store a small dataset in a dictionary and print values.

Lesson 2: Reading and Writing Files

open(), read(), write(), close()

Text files vs. CSV

Exercise: Write a list of items to a file and read them back.

Lesson 3: Using JSON for Structured Data

import json, json.dump(), json.load()

Nested dictionaries/lists

Exercise: Save a dictionary to a JSON file and load it back.

Lesson 4: Functions and Modularity

Functions to save/load data

Passing filenames as parameters

Exercise: Write two functions: save_data(data, filename) and load_data(filename).

Lesson 5: Error Handling

try/except blocks

Handling missing files or incorrect data

Exercise: Try reading a file that doesn’t exist and catch the error.

Group D – Admin / Validation

Goal: Learn how to manage input validation, security basics, and permissions.

Lesson 1: Python Basics

Variables, data types, printing, input

Exercise: Ask user for input and display it.

Lesson 2: Conditionals

if, elif, else

Checking multiple conditions

Exercise: Ask user for a number and check if it’s positive, negative, or zero.

Lesson 3: Loops for Validation

while loops to repeat until valid input

Nested conditionals

Exercise: Ask the user for a number between 1–10 until they give a valid number.

Lesson 4: Functions for Reuse

Encapsulate validation logic

Parameters and return values

Exercise: Write a function get_valid_number(min, max) that asks for input until valid.

Lesson 5: Dictionaries & Permissions

Use dictionaries to store “user roles”

Check role before allowing certain actions

Exercise: Create a dictionary of users with roles and print “Access granted” if role is admin.

Group E – Testing / Documentation

Goal: Learn how to test code, check for errors, and document work.

Lesson 1: Python Basics

Variables, lists, dictionaries, printing

Exercise: Practice small code snippets and predict outputs.

Lesson 2: Functions

Define functions with inputs/outputs

Exercise: Write a function and test it with multiple inputs.

Lesson 3: Assertions and Simple Tests

Use assert to check correctness of code

Writing small test cases

Exercise: Write a function that adds numbers and assert that add(2,3) == 5.

Lesson 4: Debugging Techniques

Printing intermediate values

Using comments to explain logic

Exercise: Debug a broken function by printing variable states.

Lesson 5: Documentation

Writing meaningful comments

Explaining what each function does

Exercise: Add docstrings and inline comments to previous exercises.
